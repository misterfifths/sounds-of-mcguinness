## McGuinness Boulevard is loud.

Greenpoint's own "McGuinness Expressway" (aka the "Pulaski Raceway", aka the "Brooklyn Boulevard of Death") connects the Pulaski Bridge to the BQE. It started life as humble Oakland Street, but was widened in 1954. I can't find anything blaming the project on Robert Moses, but I'm going to assume he strongly approved.

I happen to live about 50 feet from it.

### The project

This project started because I wondered just how loud the road actually is. And moreover, how loud is *too* loud, both legally and psychically?

So, I bought a [fancy microphone](daytonaudio.com/index.php/imm-6-idevice-calibrated-measurement-microphone.html) and recorded the thing for 6 days.

### How loud?

In the graph below, the blue line is the average volume, and the orange is the peak volume. The horizontal lines at the top represent NYC's legal sound limits. So, when the orange lines cross the upper horizontal lines, a law was potentially broken. As you can see, this happens a lot.

And, according to the World Health Organization's recommendations, it is *almost never* quiet enough for uninterrupted sleep.

### What now?

Well, here's the thing. The laws governing this stuff are effectively unenforceable without a serious investment of both equipment and personnel.

The speed limit on McGuinness was already [reduced from 30 to 25 MPH](http://gothamist.com/2014/04/23/mcguinness_boulevard_gets_slow_zone.php) in 2014, but it's probably safe to assume [the reduction made little difference](http://gothamist.com/2014/11/08/speed_limit_mcguinness.php). After all, it's a wide, 4-lane road that connects to two major highways. What's a city (and an annoyed resident) to do?

The noise code shares problems with many traffic laws: it's violated regularly, and only enforced if a police officer is in the right place at the right time. Traffic cameras can catch speeders and those who run red lights. Perhaps technology could help enforce noise limits as well; I lack the expertise to make a judgement about how complicated or effective that would be.

In the meantime, periodic enforcement "pushes" might be helpful. If a small group of traffic police staked out a stretch of McGuinness and issued tickets for noise violations, it would at least raise awareness that there *are* limits and that someone is paying attention. An even easier target than the noise code itself is the use of compression brakes (aka "jake" or "engine" brakes). These are [illegal except in emergencies](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/New%20York/admin/title24environmentalprotectionandutiliti/chapter2noisecontrol?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:newyork_ny$anc=JD_24-236), yet I counted at least 58 uses in my 6-day recording session.

Certainly the NYPD has bigger fish to fry. But given the number of people in the city who live along highways, and the repercussions on [sleep, heart disease, stress, child development, and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise), the problem at least deserves some recognition.
