### What's this then?

I live on McGuinness Boulevard, a loud, 4-lane road in Brooklyn. This project started because I wondered just how loud it actually is. And how loud is *too* loud, both legally and psychically.

*It looks much calmer with no cars on it.*

To that end, I learned a lot about sound (turns out it's really complicated) and the laws concerning traffic noise. I bought a microphone and recorded the street for 6 days. The result is some [pretty graphs](analyze/graphs) and an [obnoxious supercut](https://soundcloud.com/tim-clem-404086192/sounds-of-mcguinness) of all the (potentially) illegal road noise.

This document describes my research and process.
